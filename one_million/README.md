##Task

Write a Ruby script that outputs the numbers 1 to 1 million as words

##My Response

I created a module, IntegerConverter, which can be prepended to the Fixnum class to add the functionality to convert integers from one to one million into words, refactoring at each stage to ensure readability and clean code.

to print out the numbers one to one million and complete the task, I added the script one_million.rb, which can be run with the command 

```
$ruby ./one_million.rb
```
